# FBMC-channel-estimation-based-on-SVR
The Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC), as a candidate system in 5G, has a better spectrum characteristic than the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). However, it brings the problem of the inherent imaginary interference, resulting in the increase of difficulties in channel estimation. In this paper, based on the SVR interpolation, a new method about the time-varying channel estimation of FBMC is proposed. The new method firstly uses auxiliary pilots to eliminate the imaginary interference, then interpolates the time-varying channel vector via SVR. The simulation results show that, compared to the traditional algorithms, the channel estimation effect of the newly proposed method is greatly improved with the little loss of efficiency, but has a higher estimation accuracy.

It is the matlab code of one of my papers"A Time-Varying Channel Estimation based on the SVR-interpolation in FBMC Systems".<br/>

And,thanks to Ronald Nissel and Markus Rupp.Some parts of this code are based on their paper and can be downloaded from their website.
